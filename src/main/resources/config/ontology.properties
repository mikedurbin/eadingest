# The full ontology of relationships and content model PIDs 
# needed to represent hierarchical data in fedora.  
#
# NOTE: changes to this file must be accompanied by corresponding
# changes to the content model objects in the main/resources/foxml
# directory.  Within those foxml there may be references to 
# predicates or URIs in the XSLT code or the WSDL that must also
# be consistent.  This configuration file should obviate the need
# for changes to java code.
#
# WARNING: code to purge, summarize or index a collection will not
# work if this file has been altered since the objects were initially
# ingested as it uses this predicate information to query for related
# objects as it traverses the hierarchy.

######################
# Predicates
# 
# All used predicates are listed here. Given 
# subject-predicate-object relationships, by default
# code will assume a relationship's subject and object
# match the semantics of the predicate name (elaborated 
# in the comments), but if for some reason you wish to 
# use a predicate that inverts the subject and object,
# simply replace the property with inverted "-inverted"
# appended to it's name and the name of the inverse 
# relationship.  
#
# For example, if you wished to store the "part" relationship
# on the whole, rather than the part you should specify
# the following property:
#
# IS_PART_OF-relationship-inverted:info:fedora/fedora-system:def/relationships-external#hasPart 
# 
# The mere presence of the inverse relationship in this
# properties file implies that you wish to use it.

# A predicate that should link to a literal value of either
# "VISIBLE", "HIDDEN" or "UNDISCOVERABLE" to indicate that 
# the object should be visible (and discoverable), hidden 
# (and undiscoverable) or undiscoverable. 
visibility-predicate:http://fedora.lib.virginia.edu/relationships#visibility

# The fedora relationship between an object and the content model to which
# it conforms.
# The current codebase does not support this relationship being 
# inverted!
HAS_MODEL-relationship:info:fedora/fedora-system:def/model#hasModel

# The fedora relationship between an object and the parent object in the
# logical hierarchical representation.
# The current codebase does not support this relationship being 
# inverted!
IS_PART_OF-relationship:info:fedora/fedora-system:def/relations-external#isPartOf

# The fedora relationship between an object and the logical hierarchical peer
# that precedes it sequentially.
# The current codebase does not support this relationship being 
# inverted!
FOLLOWS-relationship:http://fedora.lib.virginia.edu/relationships#follows

# The fedora relationship between an object and another object that contains
# the marc record with additional metadata for the material(s) represented
# by that object.
HAS_MARC-relationship:http://fedora.lib.virginia.edu/relationships#hasCatalogRecordIn

# The fedora relationship between an object (with the marc-cmodel content model) 
# and a container object (with the container-cmodel content model) that is tracked
# in that marc record.
DEFINES_CONTAINER-relationship:http://fedora.lib.virginia.edu/relationships#definesContainer
#DEFINED_CONTAINER-relationship-inverted:

# The fedora relationship between an object and the container object in which 
# the real-world object is contained.  This relationship may from a logical 
# object to a container object, or from one container object to another in the
# case of nested containers like a folder in a box). 
IS_CONTAINED_WITHIN-relationship:http://fedora.lib.virginia.edu/relationships#isContainedWithin
#IS_CONTAINED_WITHIN-relationship-inverted:

# The fedora relationship between on object and another object that contains
# the metadata for the current object.
IS_METADATA_PLACEHOLDER_FOR-relationship:http://fedora.lib.virginia.edu/relationships#isMetadataPlaceholderFor

# The fedora relationship between the object and another object that has the
# digitized contgent for the current object.
IS_CONTENT_PLACEHOLDER_FOR-relationship:http://fedora.lib.virginia.edu/relationships#isContentPlaceholderFor


# The fedora relationship between an object that represents a single
# physical item and an object that contains a digital representation
# of one surface of that physical item.  Typically that would be the
# scan or photograph of one side of page for paper objects (like letters
# books, etc.).
